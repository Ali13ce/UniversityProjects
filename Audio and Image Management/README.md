# Image and Audio Recognition Project by Alice, Davide, and Alberto

## Overview
This collaborative project by Alice, Davide, and Alberto focuses on three key areas: Speaker Identification, Image Recognition, and Image Retrieval.

### Speaker Identification
- **Objective:** Develop a model capable of identifying a speaker using their voice.
- **Approach:** Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features to recognize individuals based on speech.

### Image Recognition
- **Objective:** Recognize people from images.
- **Approach:** Utilize a CNN model to identify a person from their picture.

### Image Retrieval
- **Objective:** Retrieve ten images of famous individuals resembling a given face.
- **Approach:** Employ a CNN to extract neural features from images and perform comparisons.

## Project Files
- `Acquisition.ipynb`: Code for recording audio and capturing images.
- `Demo.ipynb`: Code for running a live demo of the three tasks.
- Three additional files: Each corresponding to the specific code and models used for the tasks above.

This project demonstrates our expertise in audio and image recognition, leveraging CNNs for effective identification and retrieval tasks.
