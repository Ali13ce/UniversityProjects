## Overview
This project, undertaken by a team of three, focuses on two primary tasks in the realm of text mining: Text Classification and Text Clustering.

### Text Classification
- **Objective:** Develop a classifier to distinguish between fake and real news articles.
- **Details:** This task involves creating a model capable of accurately predicting the authenticity of news articles.

### Text Clustering
- **Objective:** Cluster articles based on their source.
- **Details:** The goal here is to group articles, organizing them by similarities in their source information.

### Common Preprocessing
- Both tasks involve a crucial preprocessing phase. This phase prepares the articles, making them suitable for the respective models.

### Dataset
- The dataset used for this project is the 'Fake News' dataset, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/techykajal/fakereal-news).

This project showcases our collaborative efforts in tackling key challenges in text mining, namely the classification and clustering of news articles.
