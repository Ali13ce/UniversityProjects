# Data Management and Visualization Project

Our team, consisting of three members – myself (Alice), along with Davide and Alberto – has conducted a detailed analysis of tweets from Earth Day (April 22, 2021). We specifically focused on tweets featuring hashtags like #earthday, #plasticfree, #climatechange, and others. To ensure a broad, international reach, these hashtags were translated into multiple languages, capturing diverse global perspectives.

Our approach involved the application of Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining techniques to the collected data. We then further enriched this data by integrating it with various socioeconomic and environmental indices. Once this comprehensive dataset was stored in Mongo, we developed insightful visualizations to showcase our findings. These visualizations can be accessed at [Earthday Project Visualizations](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/davide.miori/viz/Earthday-ProgettoDMDVCarloneMioriOndei_16311093096770/Storia).

This repository includes a PDF document that provides a summary of our project in Italian. Additionally, there are three Jupyter notebook files: The 'producer' and 'consumer' files encompass the code for collecting tweets from Twitter in real-time, and the 'MainCode' file contains the script used to generate the final dataset.
