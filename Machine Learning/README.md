# Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project entails the construction of three classifiers using Knime to address distinct classification tasks: binary, 3-class, and 10-class classification.

### Classifiers

#### Binary Classification
- **Objective:** Classify fetal state as either 'Normal' or 'Pathologic'.
- **Details:** The output variable represents two states of fetal health.

#### 3-Class Classification
- **Objective:** Classify fetal state into one of three categories - 'Normal', 'Suspect', or 'Pathologic'.
- **Details:** This task expands the classification to encompass an intermediate state ('Suspect') alongside the two primary states.

#### 10-Class Classification
- **Objective:** Predict the FHR (Fetal Heart Rate) pattern.
- **Details:** This complex classification problem involves identifying one of ten specific patterns detected in the fetus.

### Dataset
- The dataset used for this project, the Cardiotocography dataset, is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/cardiotocography#).

This project showcases the application of machine learning techniques in medical diagnostics, particularly in the monitoring and analysis of fetal health.
