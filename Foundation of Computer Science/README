echo Project Overview:
echo This project involves comprehensive data analysis using Jupyter notebooks. The key objectives and accomplishments include:
echo.
echo 1. Extraction of the most recent and the least recent data for each university from the Times dataset, resulting in two separate dataframes.
echo 2. Calculation of the improvement in income for each university between the least recent and the most recent data points.
echo 3. Identification of the university with the largest income increase.
echo 4. Computation of the maximum difference between rankings for each university using only the most recent data points.
echo 5. Calculation of the number of male and female students for each country from the most recent Times dataset data point.
echo 6. Identification of universities with a female-to-male ratio below the average across all universities.
echo 7. Computation of the fraction of students in each country attending the universities identified in the previous point.
echo 8. Processing of the 'educational_attainment_supplementary_data.csv' file, focusing on entries with complete country_name and series_name.
echo 9. Creation of a dataframe with country_name, series_name, year, and value columns from the attainment data.
echo 10. Determination of the number of rankings in which each university appears.
echo 11. Analysis of the frequency of each university's appearance in the Times ranking.
echo 12. Identification of universities that appear at most twice in the Times ranking.
echo 13. Discovery of universities that hold the same position in all three rankings in any year.
