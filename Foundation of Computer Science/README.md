Project Overview:
This project involves an extensive analysis using Jupyter notebooks, addressing various data processing and analysis challenges. The key tasks accomplished in this project are:

1. Extraction of the most recent and the least recent data for each university from the Times dataset, resulting in two separate dataframes.
2. Calculation of the improvement in income for each university between the least recent and the most recent data points.
3. Identification of the university with the largest increase in income.
4. Using only the most recent data points from each ranking, computation of the maximum difference between the rankings for each university. Note that some rankings are expressed as a range.
5. Calculation of the number of male and female students for each country from the most recent Times dataset data point.
6. Identification of universities with a female-to-male ratio below the average across all universities.
7. For each country, computation of the fraction of students attending the universities identified in point 6 relative to the total number of students in all universities in that country.
8. Reading the file 'educational_attainment_supplementary_data.csv', discarding any row with missing country_name or series_name.
9. Creation of a new dataframe from the attainment data with four columns: country_name, series_name, year, and value.
10. Determination of the number of rankings in which each university appears (it suffices to appear in one year for each ranking).
11. In the Times ranking, computation of the number of times each university appears.
12. Identification of universities that appear at most twice in the Times ranking.
13. Finding universities that, in any year, have the same position in all three rankings.
