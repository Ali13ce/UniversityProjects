# High Dimensional Data Analysis Project

## Team Members

## Project Aim
The goal of this project is to replicate and extend the analysis presented in the 8th chapter of “Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models” by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson. This chapter focuses on various methods for handling missing values.

## Approach
- **Starting Point:** Analysis from the book's 8th chapter.
- **Integration:** We have enhanced the original work with insights and techniques learned during our course lectures.

## Datasets
- **Chicago Datasets:** Available at the book's [Github page](https://github.com/topepo/FES/tree/master/08_Handling_Missing_Data).
- **Scat Dataset:** Available in R.

This project is a collaborative effort where we apply and combine the methodologies described by Kuhn and Johnson with our own learning and insights from our course, specifically targeting high dimensional data analysis and handling of missing data.
